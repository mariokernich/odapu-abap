## üìå How to use

To set up and use this project, you need to use [abapgit](https://abapgit.org/). Follow these steps:

1. Install abapgit in your ABAP system.
2. Clone this repository using abapgit.
3. Follow the abapgit instructions to pull and activate the project.

For more details, visit the [abapgit documentation](https://docs.abapgit.org/).

### Import with abapgit failed with service binding / definition

If the abapgit import failed for `ZODPU_SRV` service definition or `ZODPU_O2` service binding, then you need to manually create them.

Create new service definition `ZODPU_SRV` with the following contents:
```ABAP
@EndUserText.label: 'ODATA & APC Test Tool: Main Service'
define service ZODPU_SRV {
  expose ZCE_ODPU_INFO as Info;
  expose ZCE_ODPU_SERVICES as ODataService;
  expose ZCE_ODPU_APC as PushChannel;
  expose ZC_ODPU_OPROJ as ODataServiceProject;
  expose ZCE_ODPU_TABLE as Dictionary;
  expose ZCE_ODPU_TABLE_FIELDS as DictionaryField;
}
```

Create new service binding `ZODPU_O2`

## OnPremise specific setup steps

1. Open transaction `/UI2/SEMOBJ` and create a new semantic object: `ZODPU`.
2. Open transaction `PFCG` and create a new role: `ZODPU`.  
   - Add the Launchpad Catalog `ZODPU` and Launchpad Group `ZODPU`.  
   - Assign the role to your user.
3. Open transaction `SICF` and ensure the service node `zodpu_ui5` is activated.
4. Launch the Fiori Launchpad via `/UI2/FLP` and start the `ODAPU` app.

## Cloud / SAP BTP specific setup steps

**Note:** This environment is actually not tested yet!

1. Deploy the UI5 application form here: https://github.com/mariokernich/odapu-ui5
2. Ensure service binding `ZODPU_O2` is published
3. Open the UI5 application from HTML5 applications section or add it to an SAP Work Zone launchpad.
